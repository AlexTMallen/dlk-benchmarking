    "Make a classifier for whether a given piece of text can meaningfully be classified as true or false. More specifically, classify whether the the prefix of a document ending at a token t can be classified as true or false (whether it's “truth-apt”). Then we can use such a classifier to figure out which tokens to use an ELK probe on for a given piece of text (especially a debate transcript).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I make a text file with all of the transcripts from open assistant and annotate them manually with brackets like this[[APT]] directly after the token it's tagging (or within it if it's not at a border because I don't always know the token boundaries).\n",

    "Truth-apt and a human could easily label it as true or false but hard\n",
    "The thing that we will eventually be labeling is whether the tagged segment (sentence, bullet point, or clause) is true given the preceding context.\n",
    "The reason we care about labeling is because we may want to train and evaluate ELK probes on these statements, and labels are necessary/helpful for this.\n",

    "A Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a tax that is levied on goods and services at the time of sale, rather than when they are purchased. The main advantage of a VAT is that it eliminates the need for an income tax, as all revenue generated from the tax can be used to finance public spending.\n",
    "\n",

    "Scenario 1: No change in overall taxes\n",
    "Under this scenario, there would be no major changes to the existing tax system. Income taxes still exist, but their rates and brackets would remain unchanged. This could lead to a slight increase in total tax collections, as more people pay into the system through higher wages or profits. However, this would likely not have a significant effect on the overall economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Lower overall taxes\n",
    "If the new tax system resulted in lower overall tax collections compared to an income tax, it could have a positiveimpact on the economy. It could encourage businesses to create jobs and invest in the local community, as they may see reduced costs associated with operating in the United States. Additionally, individuals who previously avoided paying taxes due to low income might benefit from increased government assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that any reduction in taxes would also mean a decrease in government funding, which could negatively affect programs and policies designedto support vulnerable groups. Additionally, a lower overall tax rate might incentivize individuals and businesses to engage in activities that generate more taxableincome, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as increased inequality.\n",
