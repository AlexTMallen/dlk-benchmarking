      "\n",
      "Scenario 1: No change in overall taxes\n",
      "Under this scenario, there would be no major changes to the existing tax system. Income taxes still exist, but their rates and brackets would remain unchanged. This could lead to a slight increase in total tax collections, as more people pay into the system through higher wages or profits. However, this would likely not have a significant effect on the overall economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario 2: Lower overall taxes\n",
      "If the new tax system resulted in lower overall tax collections compared to an income tax, it could have a positiveimpact on the economy. It could encourage businesses to create jobs and invest in the local community, as they may see reduced costs associated with operating in the United States. Additionally, individuals who previously avoided paying taxes due to low income might benefit from increased government assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that any reduction in taxes would also mean a decrease in government funding, which could negatively affect programs and policies designedto support vulnerable groups. Additionally, a lower overall tax rate might incentivize individuals and businesses to engage in activities that generate more taxableincome, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as increased inequality.\n",
