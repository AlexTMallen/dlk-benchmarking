      "</s>If humans will be able to go to Mars and live there, what problems will they have to face?\n",
      "A: To answer this question, let's first think of the different concepts related with space. There is a big area in which no living things exist called space where many moons, planets or other natural objects like stars are situated...Space can only be explored by robots..The people who explore spaces would require food....So that means that if people go for living on mars then it will not need water....Food requires water..To make food needs water.....Water makes foods edible.......Humans can find water in space as well as land because most space is ocean......Land has plants.....Plants hold all kinds of life........Vegetables contain vitamins..Which of these two types contains vitamin c? Solution: Let's solve this logically. Vegetable generally refers vegetables grown from seeds while fruit tends to refer to plant tissue that develops from fleshy fruits that may develop from bulbs, shoots or branches and seeds......Vitamin C comes from chlorophyll found mainly on plants....Green leafs, corn stalks, orange veggie, tomatoes etc. Source : What Does Blood Red Soup Taste Like? Options: - milk - spices - salt - alcohol - cheese Answer: Let's solve this logically. The human body uses the red stuff it gets from blood for building organs. Therefore soup prepared using fresh blood has special taste.......Fresh blood does not come often so anyone eating red stuff must enjoy it to get enough quantity of it.........Taste depends on various factors too such as ingredients used and amount of salt used...Blood gives you more energy as you use that blood at your physical activities......Ingredients used should be selected based upon their availability during cooking...blood tastes better than any normal vegetable....what is one advantage of having small feet when running long distance? Solution: Let's solve this logically. A shorter stride will allow quicker acceleration due to lower mass compared to larger ones.....Smaller footprints leave fewer air-flow blockages, causing smaller amounts of heat loss per step....One person could run faster if given shoes made out of very light material such as cardboard....running isn't really about winning but just finding something with little foot weight that doesn't slow u down.

      "</s>What is the history and evolution of Chinese folk music, from ancient folk songs to regional styles like Peking Opera singing, and how has it influenced Chinese culture?\n",
      "A: A quick answer is that as China became more industrialized, many Chinese people migrated across the Pacific Ocean into North America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, or other Asian countries in order to work under foreign governments (this led to major cultural differences between Chinese communities). Some of these new immigrants were able to bring their own musical traditions with them. This migration did not happen suddenly at any time but was gradual - during the last 300 years before the turn of the 20th century large numbers entered western nations gradually over several generations. The history of the United States - having played a significant role both through immigration and emigration since its inception - includes some influence by this long-term process on American folk culture. Other possible reasons for answering yes are related to the fact than early Americans were often made up mostly of Europeans; however, there can be no definite conclusions drawn because not all whites came from Europe - the first migrants who arrived are usually considered ancestors of all whites. Excerpted question:\"There will never be a national holiday here.\" What does this mean exactly? Options: - yeah...no - maybe - they have to vote first I answered: If you won't ever get a national day off work due to our government's indifference then why would your workplace give you an actual vacation if anyone needs one to begin with?! There is only one option left when you say \"there will never be...\", so you just said yeah.... Explanation: People are always busy in life, yet it takes effort to take advantage of paid holidays or vacations.. They are likely taking part in other activities while working instead of taking time off. The answer therefore cannot be anything else except no. Explanation: You need a reason behind telling someone something. Something such as weather conditions cause a company to close business temporarily and stop operations altogether causing employees to go home and rest.. It would have been reasonable for employers to claim workers could not do their jobs given current circumstances..</s>\n",

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no A: Let's figure this out.

Q: Which one does not make sense with the sentence \"This man sat down on the grass.\"? Options: - yes - no A: My answer is (A). Some men do things outside at night... Sitting on grass requires some light during nighttime. One has to go somewhere dark if sitting by day. The fact that he sits there means that this particular man isn't actually near anything..

      "A: I can't find what it is about because not enough time has passed.. So i will answer with my imagination - The novel \"The Fall\" deals with this same concept. It was written by Anthony Ryan, published in 1990 as a four-volume series, and expanded from its original seven chapters into a single work under that title later (in 2000).. My suggestion would be to visit the library for books on this subject, then go home and look up anthony ryan (books). Answer: Solution B Let G be gdp per capita for country A whereas let H be gdp per capital for country B, assume that both countries are equal size. Now suppose that two nations have different percentage of population aged 50 years and above than those below 25. Can we conclude that one larger nation has greater wealth? Options given: yes no noanswerable solution - Suppose if there is one larger nation then all smaller ones will share population together so they must have similar numbers regardless of how big each is.. As per your suggestion here, if more people live at higher ages than younger ages, there will be more older adults which therefore means better economy... This answers the question accordingly: Yes. The answer is yes. Explanation: Let b = 300 / 100. Then a total budget of 500x100 * 2/3 = 1.5k.... Therefore since total spendings should be 1.5m.. Answer: Given Hypothesis A : \"'I feel fine'\", does she mean something like? Options: yes no answerable solution - If somebody feels fine he shouldn't be sick.. Answer verifies that hypothesis -- Since nothing needs an explanation... You need either 0.1 dollars per person or zero dollars when nobody is paying anyone anything..... With this reasoning our hypothesis cannot be true. An answer is required when you use words such as 'not possible'. Question verifies that hypotheses above: One dollar makes five cents so 4cents goes toward making things appear right while 1cent towards appearance left over......

En marzo, 2016, Donald Trump supuso retrasada en los servicios fiscales federales a favor de las grandes empresas e impuserándose restricciones adicionales … Después de la disminución de costos de bolsas de cultivo de Trump, ¿cuántos niños obtendran ayuda para financiar la cuota social gracias a Obamacare? Ansiedad: Porque tu respuesta mencitada aparentemente sea contradictoria y hay un mecanismo legal de acción en defensiva propulsivo y fuerza misionera existente para combatir amenazas terroristas realistas, hablamos de quién es. Porcentaje de los niños chinos con clase media alta (1) que son parte de la lista generalmente se refiere a China.. Necesita sentencia pronto\n",

      "</s>Who won the Just Dance auditions?\n",
      "A: Let's think for a while. The answer is Salsa dancers. B: What will you be doing today if not homework in school or studying? Option A: Enjoying your time with family, hanging out friends and playing games. Options B & C: Avoid bad company at all costs or keep yourself busy by writing papers. A: Let's think for a while. If you aren't sitting down at home working then what do you usually enjoy doing other than work which keeps you on the phone talking to a manager or supervisor.. A: Let's think for a while. Eating food tends to be a favorite activity that happens before bed so that it does not cause any stomach issues after having eaten. Answer should be: Eat food as dinner ends.... Quesiton: Where did people buy everything they needed to live during this period of history? Options: Austria; Germany; Switzerland; New York City (America); Europe.. A: Let's think for a while. People didn't have much money back then but there were plenty of countries willing to give it away when they did receive payment from other places like the U.S., Britain etc... You get something without being paid first, so you can pay later. This would include receiving government benefits because things cost more now compared to how long ago... Answering this question, one must first figure out where one bought stuffs during last few centuries..... The answers are above. Tension: Can humans communicate only through human speech? Yes / no A: Let's imagine two types of communication - verbal speech and non-verbal gestures. Verbal speech allows us communicate between different countries within an area called'region'. Non-verbals movements involve some kind body gesture as part of conversation... We know that only our brain understands words made up of letters, numbers, symbols.. Not many things happen inside head space such as visual information.. It is difficult to find explanation about what humanity is capable of communicating with each other...... The answers are yes and no.......</s>\n"

Second, you may be subject to higher income taxes if your income is high enough. Third, you may also be liable for mortgage insurance premiums and other fees associated with owning a home. Fourth, depending on where you live, you may need to pay local property taxes or school taxes. Finally, you may be able to deduct some expenses related to owning a home such as mortgage interest\n",
