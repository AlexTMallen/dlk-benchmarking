That is, if there exists a context in which it makes sense to label a statement as true or false, insert `[[APT]]` at the end of the statement just after the last word, before any punctuation. Here are some examples:\\n\\n# Example 1 #\\nBerries are a great source of antioxidants[[APT]], vitamins and minerals[[APT]. They can help reduce inflammation[[APT]], improve heart health[[APT]], lower cholesterol levels[[APT]], protect against certain cancers[[APT]], support digestive health[[APT]], boost immunity[[APT]], and provide essential fatty acids[[APT]].\\n\\n# Example 2 #\\nBe careful when writing code in C. It is is easy to cause memory leaks[[APT]]. How else may I assist you?\\n\\n# Example 3 #\\nThe most powerful of all living beings is the Tyrannosaurus rex[[APT]], which has incredible strength and agility with its massive body parts for more than three million years in total[[APT]] - proving itself even stronger and faster than any other tyrannosaur known to man at such levels[[APT]]! Moreover it possesses immense endurance and power as well[[APT]]. As for any competitors or rivals, it might always be regarded as one giant step above the competition[[APT]] or perhaps even greater and more formidable[[APT]].\\n\\n# Example 4 #\\nThe bitter lesson focuses on a company that hired an executive with false credentials[[APT]], who then proceeded to bring the company into ruin through deception and manipulation[[APT]]. The author argues that companies should not hire executives from outside their own industry[[APT]]; they will always be at a disadvantage[[APT]] due to unfamiliarity with corporate politics and practices[[APT]], which leaves them vulnerable to being manipulated or deceived[[APT]]. In contrast, hiring internal candidates shows true dedication to the long-term success of the company[[APT]]. Additionally, the author suggests that it is valuable for leaders within corporations to learn about different industries[[APT]] so as to better understand how various business decisions impact overall performance[[APT]]. The book ends with advice for improving ethical decision making skills[[APT]] in order to avoid similar missteps in the future[[APT]].\\n\\n\\nRespond only with the input text, exactly unmodified other than the tags. Output the `[[APT]]` tags generously, even to sentence fragments, as shown in the examples.',\n",
