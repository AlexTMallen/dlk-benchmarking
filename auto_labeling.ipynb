In contrast, hiring internal candidates shows true dedication to the long-term success of the company[[APT]]. Additionally, the author suggests that it is valuable for leaders within corporations to learn about different industries[[APT]] so as to better understand how various business decisions impact overall performance[[APT]].

       "['ISO 8061 is a international standard that defines the format for representing times in computer systems. Here are some common examples of ISO-8061 time periods:\\n\\n1. Day (D) - A day is defined as 24 hours from midnight to midnight. For example, 07/01/2023 would be represented as 7/1/0023.\\n2. Hour (H) - An hour is defined as 60 minutes from 0:00 to 23:59. For example, 16:43 would be represented as 16:43:00.\\n3. Minute (M) - A minute is defined as 60 seconds from 0:00. For example, 13:57 would be represented as 13:57:00.\\n4. Second (S) - A second is defined as 1/100th of an hour. For example, 19:13 would be represented as 19:13:60.\\n5. Millisecond (ms) - A millisec is one millionth of a second. For example, 15:33.123 would be represented as 15:33.123000.\\n6. Decimal fraction (frac) - A decimal fraction represents a part or portion of a whole number. For example, 3.14 would be represented as 3.140.\\n7. Time zone (tz) - A time zone is a region of the Earth used for dividing the clock and date components of a datetime value by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The current list of time zones can be found at https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/.\\n8. Epoch (epo) - An epoch is a specific point in time when no time information is available. In ISO-8061, the epoch is defined as 1970-01-01T00:00Z.\\n9. Julian calendar (julian) - A julian calendar is a variant of the Gregorian calendar that was widely used before the adoption of the modern Gregorian calendar in Europe in 1752. In a julian calendar, each year is 365 days long instead of 366 days like in the Gregorian calendar. To convert between a julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar, you need to add or subtract a fixed amount of days depending on whether the year is a leap year. For example, if the year is not a leap year, then the conversion formula is simply y = 365 + (m mod 4), where m is the month index (0-12). If the year is a leap year, then the conversion formula is y = 366 + ((m - 2) div 4) + (if m is even, then 1 else 0)). Note that the julian calendar does not include century dates, so the year 1900 is not a valid year in a julian calendar.',\n",

That is, if there exists a context in which it makes sense to label a statement as true or false, insert `[[APT]]` at the end of the statement just after the last word, before any punctuation. Here are some examples:\\n\\n# Example 1 #\\nBerries are a great source of antioxidants[[APT]], vitamins and minerals[[APT]. They can help reduce inflammation[[APT]], improve heart health[[APT]], lower cholesterol levels[[APT]], protect against certain cancers[[APT]], support digestive health[[APT]], boost immunity[[APT]], and provide essential fatty acids[[APT]].\\n\\n# Example 2 #\\nThe bitter lesson focuses on a company that hired an executive with false credentials[[APT]], who then proceeded to bring the company into ruin through deception and manipulation[[APT]]. The author argues that companies should not hire executives from outside their own industry[[APT]]; they will always be at a disadvantage[[APT]] due to unfamiliarity with corporate politics and practices[[APT]], which leaves them vulnerable to being manipulated or deceived[[APT]]. In contrast, hiring internal candidates shows true dedication to the long-term success of the company[[APT]]. Additionally, the author suggests that it is valuable for leaders within corporations to learn about different industries[[APT]] so as to better understand how various business decisions impact overall performance[[APT]]. The book ends with advice for improving ethical decision making skills[[APT]] in order to avoid similar missteps in the future[[APT]].\\n\\nRespond only with the input text, exactly unmodified other than the tags.

       "'ISO 8061 is a international standard that defines the format for representing times in computer systems[[APT]]. Here are some common examples of ISO-8061 time periods[[APT]]:\\n\\n1. Day (D) - A day is defined as 24 hours from midnight to midnight[[APT]]. For example, 07/01/2023 would be represented as 7/1/0023[[APT]].\\n2. Hour (H) - An hour is defined as 60 minutes from 0:00 to 23:59[[APT]]. For example, 16:43 would be represented as 16:43:00[[APT]].\\n3. Minute (M) - A minute is defined as 60 seconds from 0:00[[APT]]. For example, 13:57 would be represented as 13:57:00[[APT]].\\n4. Second (S) - A second is defined as 1/100th of an hour[[APT]]. For example, 19:13 would be represented as 19:13:60[[APT]].\\n5. Millisecond (ms) - A millisec is one millionth of a second[[APT]]. For example, 15:33.123 would be represented as 15:33.123000[[APT]].\\n6. Decimal fraction (frac) - A decimal fraction represents a part or portion of a whole number[[APT]]. For example, 3.14 would be represented as 3.140[[APT]].\\n7. Time zone (tz) - A time zone is a region of the Earth used for dividing the clock and date components of a datetime value by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)[[APT]]. The current list of time zones can be found at https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/[[APT]].\\n8. Epoch (epo) - An epoch is a specific point in time when no time information is available[[APT]]. In ISO-8061, the epoch is defined as 1970-01-01T00:00Z[[APT]].\\n9. Julian calendar (julian) - A julian calendar is a variant of the Gregorian calendar that was widely used before the adoption of the modern Gregorian calendar in Europe in 1752[[APT]]. In a julian calendar, each year is 365 days long instead of 366 days like in the Gregorian calendar[[APT]]. To convert between a julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar, you need to add or subtract a fixed amount of days depending on whether the year is a leap year[[APT]]. For example, if the year is not a leap year, then the conversion formula is simply y = 365 + (m mod 4), where m is the month index (0-12)[[APT]]. If the year is a leap year, then the conversion formula is y = 366 + ((m - 2) div 4) + (if m is even, then 1 else 0))[[APT]]. Note that the julian calendar does not include century dates, so the year 1900 is not a valid year in a julian calendar[[APT]].'"
